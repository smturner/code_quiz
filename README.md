# code_quiz

## Description
This project was to create a quiz with questions about coding. It was to have a timer that went down 5 seconds when an incorrect answer was pressed. It also was to have a end screen that showed your score and allowed you to put your initials in to save your score to the local storage. On the start page there was a link to the highscores that allows you to quickly access the scores.
